## About this fork

> [!WARNING]
> This is my own personal fork! It's not in the store and has not been tested on mobile. Use at your own risk. (Well, whatever risk comes from a slightly wonky theme).

This fork adds some minor QoL improvements to the Obsidian plugin by krios2146:
- Markdown elements, including block quotes, headers, and tags now match GitHub.com more closely
- Focus states and other elements are less distracting
- UI elements like nav rails, hotkey previews, primary buttons
- All five [GitHub Alert types](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) now have matching colors and icons:
