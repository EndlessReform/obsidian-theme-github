## Contributing
Feel free to open [issue](https://github.com/krios2146/obsidian-github/issues) on GitHub if you find some issue/bug with theme or you want me to add some plugin support. 

You also can open a [pull request](https://github.com/krios2146/obsidian-github/pulls) if you already add some plugin support or fix bugs by yourself.
